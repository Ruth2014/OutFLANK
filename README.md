OutFLANK v 0.2
========

A procedure to find Fst outliers based on an inferred distribution of neutral Fst

Version 0.2 was released in November 2017. This version fixes a bug in the OutFLANK algorithm that failed to correctly remove low heterozygosity loci when calculating neutral mean FST and df.

First, read the description of how to use OutFLANK in "OutFLANK readme.pdf" available at github.com/whitlock/OutFLANK.

After you install the package and call the library, you can view the vignette.

The vignette illustrates best practices and data checks when using the package.

The vignette can be installed by typing:
`browseVignettes("OutFLANK")` in R

This will open a web browser, and click on the `html` link.
