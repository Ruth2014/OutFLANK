OutFLANK v 0.2
========

A procedure to find Fst outliers based on an inferred distribution of neutral Fst

Version 0.2 was released in October 2017. This version fixes a bug in the OutFLANK algorithm that failed to correctly remove low heterozygosity loci when calculating neutral mean FST and df.

First, read the description of how to use OutFLANK in "OutFLANK readme.pdf" available at github.com/whitlock/OutFLANK.

Next, do the tutorial vignette, which illustrates best practices and data checks when using the package.

The vignette can be found on github at `inst/doc/OutFLANKAnalysis.html` or if the package is installed by typing:
`browseVignettes("OutFLANK")` in R
